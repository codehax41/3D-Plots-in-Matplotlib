# 3D-Plots-in-Matplotlib
This repo help us understand three dimensional plots by using widely used visualization tool - Matplotlib

# Get started
Here are some necessary dependencies we will need: <br>
- matplotlib.pyplot of cause
- mpl_toolkits.mplot3d for creating the 3d projection
- numpy for manipulating data

*We add %matplotlib inline so that we can display the plots inline in the notebook. This saves us from having to call plt.show() all the time. Alternatively, you could also use %matplotlib notebook to enter interactive mode, which allows you to simply click and drag to change the viewpoint.*
